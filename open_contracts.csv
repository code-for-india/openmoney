Financial Management Reform- Implementation ofAccrual Based Double Entry Accounting System Most of the ULBs had been following cash basedsingle entry accountingsystem wherein data for preparation of Balance Sheet cannot easily beidentified. In fact in this systemthere is no provision for preparation of Balance Sheet though ULBs are required to maintain records of assets and liabilities invarious forms (such as register of deposits register of tools and plants the DCB register etc.). However in practice many ofthese records are not updated by the ULBs regularly and thus the data available is insufficient to arrive at the actual financialposition of the ULBs.

General Manager(P & IS) NHAI G-5/6 Sector10 Dwarka NewDelhi Tel:011-25074100 Ext 1272 E-mail:pramod@nhai.org Annexure-A Electronic Toll Collection System In India tolling onNational Highways started in a big way with the National Highways Development Project (NHDP) launched by the Government in the year2000. As on date nearly 220 Toll Plazas are operational on National Highways and more sections are being added at regularintervals. Currently the tolloperations are mainly manual whereby the receipt and collectionof money is done manually and the receipts are issued with the helpof computers. In view of the fast-growingtraffic on national highway network in the coming years Govt. of India has decided introduction of Electronic Toll Collection inIndia. Electronic payment apopular mode of toll collection worldwide processes the financial transactions without human intervention at the toll plaza. ETC in India Presently ETC systems areoperational at very few toll plazas in stand-alone mode. India has distinct advantage in adopting ETC system as there are no legacy systems unlike other developed countries. Thishelpedin selecting a simple and robust ETC technology which is scalable reliable inexpensive to the road users and inter-operableacross the country. Selection of ETC technology With that objective theGovernment constituted a Committee under Shri Nandan Nilekani Chairman Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) toexamine all technologies available for Electronic Toll Collection and recommend the most suitable one for implementation inIndia. The Committeesubmitted itsreport recommending RFID based on ISO 18000-6C Standards for Electronic Toll Collection on National Highways in India. System Architecture It is essential to networkall the toll plazas for seamless data communication between toll plazas and the Central Clearing House. The entiretransactiondetails of all the Tag accounts will be stored in the Central Database. CentralClearingHouse Point of Sale Bank/ Financial Institution Regulatory Authority Web Portal / User Interface TollPlaza System Operation : Before issuance of RFIDTags the road users need to register with the agency with the basic details like Name Address Vehicle type Vehicle registrationno. etc. This information will be stored in the central Database along with the unique identification code of Tag. Each ETC lanewill beequipped with Automatic Vehicle Classification (AVC) system for cross verification of vehicle categories to avoid any misuse ofTags. The ETC management software will compare the class of vehicle as per the Tag account and the AVC class. In case ofdiscrepancy the system triggers the Camera fitted in the lane and captures the image of thevehicle along with the number plate. CENTRAL TOLL CLEARING HOUSE (CCH) A centralized back office operation or Central TollClearing House is mandatory for theoperation of interoperable ETC systems. The Central Clearing House concept is a transactionmanagement system which will enablemultiple Toll Collection Agenciesto share toll transaction data and revenue reconciliation. Irrespective of the tollplazas being operated by NHAI or BOT concessionaires the Tag information along with the Plaza ID will be sent to the CentralClearing House. The CCH system debits the applicable amount from the account of road users and credits to the Toll Operator. The CCH runs an end of daysettlement and sends details to every toll plaza operators for their receivables for that particular day. The financial settlementswill be done through a Bank. ETC Implementation NHAI got a new Company ""Indian Highways Management Company Limited IHMCL)"" incorporated with equity participation from NHAI(25%) Concessionaires(50%) andFinancial Institutions (25%) primarily for implementation of ETC inIndia. Further bidshave beeninvited for the following: (i) Empanelment of agencies for Toll Plaza ETC Systems. (ii) Selection of agency for provisioning Central Clearing HouseServices on Pan-India basis.

India has the secondlargestroad network in the world whichcarries 85% ofits passengertraffic and 60% of its freight.National highwaysconstitute just 2% of this network but incur36%of the more than 140000 people whodieannually fromroad crashes. While the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) is thenodal authority for the building maintaining and safety of thesehighways many agencies engage intraffic control and enforcement and highway securityleaving the scopeof organizational road safetyresponsibilities broadly defined. Various activities are performed by differentauthorities: e.g. vehicle fitness is checkedby State Transport Authoritiestraffic rules are enforced by the State Traffic Policeencroachment and other such matters aredealt by State Police/Highway Administrations. ExistingHighway Patrolsnormally termed RoutePatrols areprovided by either BOT/OMT Concessionaires orO&M contractors and lack statutory powers to prosecuteoffenders. Consequentlyforenforcement andotherrelated activitiesNHAI depends upon Local Police/Administrations whichunder the Highway Prevention & Regulation Act? 2002 can takeaction againstoffenders through theDistrict Courts. However in the absence effectivePolice highway enforcement this is non-operative. There is no empowered road policing of national highways in India along the lines ofRPF in Railways andCISFin Airports/Civil Aviationandthis conceptnote outlines therequirements for aproject to assess thefeasibility of implementing a NationalHighway Patrol (NHP). WhileIndia is successfully upgrading itshighway infrastructure from two-lane tofour-lane and four-lane tosix-lane it is equally important to improve their safety as well as their trafficcapacity. The specific goal ofthe proposed NHPis to enhancethe delivery of sustainableroad transport by reducing the economic and social burden of serious and fatal injuries caused by roadcrashes on national highways. In order toachieve thisgoalit will be important to formulate a practical organizational structure forthe proposedNHP which coordinates withthe many local and national agenciesresponsible for administration enforcement building and maintenance of roads and highways. Suchan agency should incorporate the needs and responsibilities ofconcessionaires who have been given obligatory agreements by the NHAI. Therefore the proposed NHPshould have a broad-based inclusive and collaborative strategy toguideits effective andefficient operational delivery. In developing the proposedNHP considerationmust be givento goodpractices being adopted incertain Indian states those being implemented in developed countries and those in countries of theAsian Regionwith similar traffic environments. Duties of theproposed NHP The proposed NHPwouldbe a pro-active organizationgiving ultimate priorityto the safetyof national highway users to ensure theprevention of road fatalities andinjuries. Key duties wouldinclude: 1. Enforcing specific roadsafety laws andregulations governing unsafe behaviors such as speeding; non-wearing of safetybelts childrestraints and helmets; and drunk and druggeddriving; and commercial vehicle safety requirementssuchasdriver hours; weight limits; unsafe loading; and the carriage of hazardous and dangerous materials. 2. Securingthe scene ofroad crashes aswell as providingfirstaid to the injured and mobilizing emergencyservices to ensure rapidstabilizationof victims injuries and transport to appropriate hospitals. 3. Preparing traffic crashreports and creating a relateddatabase recording precise crash locations all relevant contributing factors (including driver passenger vulnerable road user vehicle and road factors; time of dayandweek;and weather conditions) andfatalities andnature of injuries incurred. 4. Conducting investigations offatal roadcrashes to assesscontributing factors. 5. Undertaking periodic surveys oftraffic speeds and safetybelt/child restraint and helmet wearing toassess enforcement effectiveness. 6. Providing education information and assistanceto all road users. 7. Curtailing unauthorizedoccupation or encroachmentof the highways. 8. Liaising with all responsible agencies for thesafe and efficient movement of traffic as well as maintenance of the highway. 9. Responding tothe occurrence of crime in thevicinity of highway corridors and reporting itto local policestations. 10. Safeguarding roadway assets including the road furniture. 11. Supporting safe VIP travel. Challenges At present some of the National Highwaysbeing maintained by NHAI areunder Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangements: viz. BOT/ OMT; and it will be necessary to gain consentfromthese stakeholders forthe proposed NHP. It is likely that Concessionaires wouldalso agree tothe creation of the proposedNHP as in addition to improving road safety performanceit would also safeguard their interestsin the proper functioning of TollPlazas trafficmanagement andO&M operations. National highways run through the states and a StateSupport Agreementwill have to be implemented for the smooth operationof the proposed NHP. Theroles of State Transport Authorities StateTrafficPolice /State Policewill need to be defined vis--vis the proposed NHPtoavoid the overlapping of duties/actions. Scope of Proposed NHPFeasibility Study A feasibility studyof the proposed NHP will be conducted to: 1. Evaluate existing traffic law enforcement mechanismsregulationsand identify shortcomings. 2. Conduct official study tours to selected best practice jurisdictionsto assess options and deliberate uponproposals beingmadefor the proposedNHP. 3. Identify and suggest systems tools and tacticsforeffective andefficient highway patrolling. 4. Analyze options fortheparent/host Ministry of the NHP and recommenda preferredapproach. 5. Make recommendations on defining the functionsresponsibilities duties and authority of the proposedNHP and other concerned stakeholders suchas highway concessionairescontractors PWDs local police and civic agencies. 6. Make recommendations for powers to be given to the proposed NHP for traffic enforcement control and regulation emergency response crash investigation and identify areas where roles responsibilities and duties require legal definition. 7. Suggest an institutional structureandassociated tasks for theproposed NHP and assessrelatedmanpower requirements and trainingneeds. 8. Define workingmechanisms and command structurefor the delegation of powers at HQ zonal andsub-zonal level in the proposed NHP and the reporting relationships with theparent/host Ministry and key partner agencies. 9. Outline a three-phaseimplementationstrategyfor the proposed NHP for years 1 3 and 5 which includes human resources (staff and trainingneeds) equipment promotional activities andfinancing requirements (initial and recurrent). 10. Draft enabling legislation for the proposed NHP based upon the above findings and recommendations. Consultants shallbe required tohave various interactions with Stakeholders/ State Police/ StateTransport Department/ Safety Consultants/ RPF Railways/ and CISF Airports/CivilAviation.

The COTS software should be able to linkseamlessly to the geo-database for integration of attribute and map data to display GIS thematic maps? We are constrained from bidding as your bid document asks usto link the proposed COTS solution to ""ArcGIS"" software which uses an extremely proprietary and non-interoperable GIS databaseformat called Geo-database (ref page no 68 of your bid document). This is a clear hindrance in our and other prospective biddersability to provide ou an open scalable and cost effective COTS solution...... It is understood that ArcGIS does not use extremelyproprietary and Non-interoperableGIS format. It follows Openmechanism for information exchange betweengeodatabases and other external systems. Sharing data is greatly simplified using the geodatabase XML specification where Externalapplications can receive XML data streams including exchange of complete lossless datasets; Interchange of simple feature sets (similar to shapefileinterchange); Exchange of change-only (delta) record sets using XMLstreams to pass updates and changes among geodatabases and other external data structures. In-built GIS functionality of COTS software is optionalprovided it comes without additional cost burden to client. However integration of this external GIS with road database in COTSsoftware is a mandatory requirement and shall be jointly defined by the Implementation Consultant and the COTSsoftware supplier.

There are 1.11crore members in 10 14926 SHGs exclusivelyforwomen. A total of 39495 Village Organizations(VOs) 1098 Mandal Samakhyas (MSs) and 22 Zilla Samakhyas have come into existence in 22 districts. As on today the total Savings and Corpus of SHG Members are Rs.3383.10 croresand Rs.5070.51 crores respectively. (b)Need and Background ofAssignment TheCBO Federations i.e. VO MS and ZS are involved in both financial and non-financial activities viz. savings mobilisations lendingto member organisations micro-insurance and pension livelihood activities health etc. Currently they are dealinglarge volumes of financial transactions and maintainingmanual books of accounts. As the accountingpractices and treatment varyacross various livelihoods financial and social development activities the manual accounting systembecame more complex for CBOs. The literacy among CBO members and the functionaries is very limited. As a result of thismaintaining accounts in an accurate and up to date manner became challenging task to the CBOs and their staff. Inmanual system there is a little scope for standardisation and bringing in uniformity in accounting systems. Manual records areeasier to be falsified modified altered or vanished as compared to computerized records which become very safe when usingpasswords firewalls and back-ups. Dueto manual accounting system SERP is not able tomonitor and provide effective facilitation and nurturing support to CBOs. Computerised Accounting Systems in CBOs address theabove said deficiencies in manual system besides providing for greater transparency standardisation and application ofaccounting standards consolidation of data analysis and interpretation. It also enhancescredibility of CBOs in their members andexternal agencies and help in improving their performance.
